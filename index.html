   <center><p class="titles" id="about-us">About Me</p><p id="about-us-text">Hi, my name is Isaac, but you can call me IJ. I have been building for people for 1 year, and have been using build plugins such as World Edit (2 years), GoPaint (1 year), and GoBrush (1 year).<br><br>
   
I started building professionally in 2019, and have been doing same ever since. Back then, I offered building for free, but now that I have joined Devnics (a Minecraft company that offers wesites, GFX, plugins, and builds), I build for only a small price. You can join their discord <a id="discord-link" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/2wUkPAs" target="_blank">here.</a><br><br>

I hope you like my portfolio website. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me. My Discord: <em>IJplayz#2885</em><br><br>
